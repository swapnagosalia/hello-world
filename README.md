# hello-world
first repository created by following the github tutorial

HI People! How are you all doing?

My name is Swapna. I am 28 years old. This is the first github file that I am editing. I am very excited to learn new things and even more eager to learn github.

Hope you all rock in everything that you do! Good luck!
